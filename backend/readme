Use psql to add new items to tables
Run in psql connected to your ap_db:
Ensure pgcrypto extension is installed if you plan to use crypt in other inserts:
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgcrypto;
Run the insert script:
\i path/to/backend/init_parts.sql
The script inserts 30+ sample parts (oil filter, air filter, brake pads, etc.) and ends with a SELECT to verify.
